# Prior Elicitation for Gaussian linear model
This is the simulation scenario for prior elicitation when the user can give give direct feedback to the weight vector of the gaussian linear model. 
We have assumed guassian priors but most of our tests are on the case where weights are sparse. 
To use the code you can consider main or main_all files.
