This folder creates the data necessary for simulation using the Amazon data used in
"Hern√°ndez-Lobato, et.al. (2015). Expectation propagation in linear regression models
with spike-and-slab priors. Machine Learning, 99(3), 437-487."

There are three scripts:
  extract_amazon_data.m: read the review files and prepares the bag of words of the
  full data and extracts the response values.
  
  prepare_amazon_data.m: This script removes keywords with less than 100 times occurrence
  in the reviews (as suggested by the paper)
  
  learn_z_star.m: this script first performs cross validation on the data to learn good
  parameters for Spike-and-Slab linear regression. After that, it uses the best parameters
  to fit a model to the data. The output is a somehow ground truth of data. A visualization
  of the results can be found in the fig folder.
