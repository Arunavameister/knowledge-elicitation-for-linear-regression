This folder creates the data necessary for simulation using the Yelp 
(source: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).

There are three scripts:
  extract_yelp_academic_reviews: reads the review file, prepares the bag of words of the
  full data, and extracts the response values.
  
  prepare_yelp_academic_data.m: This script removes keywords with less than certain number of
  occurrences in the reviews.
  
  learn_z_star.m: this script first performs cross validation on the data to learn good
  parameters for Spike-and-Slab linear regression. After that, it uses the best parameters
  to fit a model to the data. The output can be used as some kind of a ground truth of
  data.
