1. Remvoe features that are all zero in the training data (in real data case scripts of main and main_all).
2. Add rng seeding somewhere so that we get reproducible results in all cases where randomness is used.
3. ground truth in the real data case should be created using a seperate set of data (not training or test).
4. Check the normalization of X_all and Y_all in all the main scripts and use main_amazon as model for them.
5. Re-visit candi scripts and update them based on new edits.
6. Add non-sequential methods in the decision_policy function for better comparison.
